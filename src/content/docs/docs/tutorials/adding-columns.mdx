title: Adding Columns to Your Sheet
description: Learn how to define your data structure by adding columns with different data types
---

Now that you've created your first workbook and sheet, it's time to define your data structure by adding columns. Columns in Sheety App are like fields in a database table - each column has a name, description, and data type that determines what kind of information it can store.

## What You'll Learn

- How to access the columns management page
- Creating columns with different data types
- Understanding available column data types
- Viewing your columns in the sheet

## Prerequisites

- A workbook with at least one sheet (complete [Creating Your First Workbook](/docs/tutorials/creating-your-first-workbook) if you haven't already)

## Understanding Columns

Before we start adding columns, let's understand what they are:

- **Columns** define the structure of your data (like "Name", "Email", "Department")
- Each column has a **data type** that determines what values it can store
- **Column names** should be descriptive and easy to understand
- You can add, edit, or remove columns at any time

## Step 1: Accessing the Columns Page

When you first create a sheet, it has no columns. You'll see an empty sheet view with a helpful message guiding you to add columns.

![Empty Sheet](/assets/docs/tutorials/adding-columns/01-empty-sheet.png)

There are two ways to access the columns management page:

### Method 1: Using the Sheet Menu

1. Click the **three dots menu** (⋯) next to the sheet name in the breadcrumb
2. Select **"Columns"** from the dropdown menu

![Sheet Menu](/assets/docs/tutorials/adding-columns/02-sheet-menu.png)

### Method 2: Right-Click on Sheet (Alternative)

You can also right-click anywhere on an empty sheet to access the context menu, though the menu approach is more reliable.

## Step 2: The Columns Management Page

Once you access the Columns page, you'll see:

- A search bar to find columns
- **"+ COLUMN"** button to add regular columns
- **"+ COMPUTE COLUMN"** button for calculated columns
- A list of all existing columns (empty for new sheets)

![Columns Page](/assets/docs/tutorials/adding-columns/03-columns-page.png)

## Step 3: Creating Your First Column

Let's add a "Full Name" column to store employee names.

1. Click the **"CREATE FIRST COLUMN"** button (or "+ COLUMN" if you already have columns)

2. The "Add New Column" dialog appears with four tabs:
   - **Definition** - Basic column information
   - **Validation** - Rules for data validation
   - **Restriction** - Access and permission settings
   - **Value Suggestion** - Auto-complete options

![Add Column Form](/assets/docs/tutorials/adding-columns/04-add-column-form.png)

3. Fill in the column details on the **Definition** tab:
   - **Name**: `Full Name`
   - **Description**: `Employee's full name`
   - **Data Type**: Select **Text** (already selected by default)

![Add Column Filled](/assets/docs/tutorials/adding-columns/05-add-column-filled.png)

:::tip[Automatic Field Name]
When you enter a column name, Sheety automatically generates a field name (like "FullName") that will be used in the API and formulas. You can see this displayed below the Name field.
:::

4. Click **"SAVE"** to create the column

You'll see a success message, and your new column will appear in the list!

## Step 4: Adding More Columns with Different Data Types

Let's add a few more columns to demonstrate the different data types available in Sheety App.

### Adding an Email Column (Text Type)

1. Click **"+ COLUMN"** button at the top
2. Enter:
   - **Name**: `Email`
   - **Description**: `Employee's email address`
   - **Data Type**: **Text**
3. Click **"SAVE"**

### Adding a Department Column (Option Type)

The Option data type creates a dropdown list of predefined choices. Perfect for department selections!

1. Click **"+ COLUMN"** button
2. Enter:
   - **Name**: `Department`
   - **Description**: `Employee's department`
   - **Data Type**: Select **Option**

![Option Type Column](/assets/docs/tutorials/adding-columns/07-option-type.png)

3. When you select "Option", additional fields appear:
   - **Allow Multi Selection** - checkbox to allow selecting multiple options
   - **Options grid** - where you define the available options
   
4. Click **"+ ADD OPTION"** to add department options:
   - Type `Engineering` in the first option
   - Click "+ ADD OPTION" again to add more departments (like "Sales", "Marketing", "HR")

5. Click **"SAVE"**

## Understanding Data Types

Sheety App offers various data types to match your data needs:

| Data Type | Description | Example Use Case |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| **Text** | Plain text or rich text (markdown) | Names, descriptions, notes |
| **Number** | Numeric values (integers or decimals) | Age, salary, quantity |
| **Check box** | True/false or yes/no values | Active status, completed tasks |
| **Date** | Date and optionally time | Birth date, hire date, deadline |
| **Option** | Single or multiple choice from predefined list | Department, status, category |
| **Row Reference** | Link to another row in a different sheet | Manager reference, related items |
| **Member** | Reference to workspace members | Assigned to, created by |
| **Sealed Option** | Once a user selects an option, only they can change it (choice is locked to the user who selected it) | Personal assignments, claimed items |
| **Vote** | Allow users to vote on options | Survey responses, polls |

:::note[Compute Columns]
There's also **Compute Columns** that automatically calculate values based on formulas. We'll cover these in a separate tutorial.
:::

## Step 5: Viewing Your Columns

Now let's see how your columns appear in the actual sheet view.

![Multiple Columns List](/assets/docs/tutorials/adding-columns/08-multiple-columns.png)

Navigate back to your sheet by clicking on **"Employees"** in the breadcrumb navigation. You'll now see your sheet with all the columns you created!

![Sheet with Columns](/assets/docs/tutorials/adding-columns/09-sheet-with-columns.png)

Your sheet now has:
- ✅ **Full Name** column (Text)
- ✅ **Email** column (Text)
- ✅ **Department** column (Option)
- ✅ **Changed At** (system column added automatically)

You're now ready to start adding data to your sheet!

## Managing Columns

Once you've created columns, you can:

- **Edit** - Click the edit icon (pencil) next to any column to modify its properties
- **Delete** - Click the delete icon (trash) to remove a column
- **Reorder** - Drag and drop columns to change their order (in the sheet view)
- **Hide/Show** - Use the "Columns" button in the sheet toolbar to hide or show specific columns

:::caution[Deleting Columns]
Deleting a column will permanently remove all data stored in that column. This action cannot be undone!

## Best Practices for Columns

When creating columns, follow these best practices:

1. **Use descriptive names** - Make column names clear and self-explanatory
2. **Add descriptions** - Help team members understand what data goes in each column
3. **Choose the right data type** - Select the most appropriate type for your data
4. **Start simple** - Begin with essential columns and add more as needed
5. **Plan your structure** - Think about relationships between data before creating columns
