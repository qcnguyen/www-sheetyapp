title: Adding Columns to Your Sheet
description: Learn how to quickly add columns to define your data structure
---

Now that you've created your first workbook and sheet, it's time to define your data structure by adding columns. Columns in Sheety App are like fields in a database table - each column has a name, description, and data type that determines what kind of information it can store.

## What You'll Learn

- How to quickly add columns using right-click
- Creating columns with different data types
- Understanding the Add Column dialog
- Alternative ways to manage columns

## Prerequisites

- A workbook with at least one sheet (complete [Creating Your First Workbook](/docs/tutorials/creating-your-first-workbook) if you haven't already)

## Understanding Columns

Before we start adding columns, let's understand what they are:

- **Columns** define the structure of your data (like "Name", "Email", "Department")
- Each column has a **data type** that determines what values it can store
- **Column names** should be descriptive and easy to understand
- You can add, edit, or remove columns at any time

## Step 1: Adding Columns with Right-Click (Recommended)

The fastest way to add columns is by right-clicking directly on the data grid. This method works whether your sheet is empty or already contains data.

When you first create a sheet, it has no columns. You'll see an empty sheet view with a helpful message:

![Empty Sheet](/assets/docs/tutorials/adding-columns/02a-empty-sheet-rightclick.png)

### Adding Your First Column

1. **Right-click** anywhere on the data grid area (the center area of the sheet)
   - This works on empty sheets or on sheets with existing data
   - You can right-click on any empty space in the grid

![Right-Click Context Menu](/assets/docs/tutorials/adding-columns/02b-rightclick-context-menu.png)

2. Select **"Add Column"** from the context menu

3. The "Add Column" dialog will open directly

:::tip[Quick Access]
Right-clicking on the data grid is the fastest way to add columns. It saves you from navigating to the Columns management page and gets you straight to creating columns!
:::

## Step 2: Creating Your First Column

Let's add a "Full Name" column to store employee names.

In the "Add Column" dialog that appeared, you'll see four tabs:
- **Definition** - Basic column information
- **Validation** - Rules for data validation
- **Restriction** - Access and permission settings
- **Value Suggestion** - Auto-complete options

![Add Column Form](/assets/docs/tutorials/adding-columns/04-add-column-form.png)

Fill in the column details on the **Definition** tab:
- **Name**: `Full Name`
- **Description**: `Employee's full name`
- **Data Type**: Select **Text** (already selected by default)

![Add Column Filled](/assets/docs/tutorials/adding-columns/05-add-column-filled.png)

:::tip[Automatic Field Name]
When you enter a column name, Sheety automatically generates a field name (like "FullName") that will be used in the API and formulas. You can see this displayed below the Name field.
:::

Click **"SAVE"** to create the column.

You'll see a success message, and your new column will appear in your sheet!

## Step 3: Adding More Columns

To add more columns, simply right-click on the data grid again and select "Add Column". Let's add a few more columns to demonstrate different data types.

### Adding an Email Column (Text Type)

1. **Right-click** on the data grid
2. Select **"Add Column"**
3. Enter:
   - **Name**: `Email`
   - **Description**: `Employee's email address`
   - **Data Type**: **Text**
4. Click **"SAVE"**

### Adding a Department Column (Option Type)

The Option data type creates a dropdown list of predefined choices - perfect for department selections!

1. **Right-click** on the data grid
2. Select **"Add Column"**
3. Enter:
   - **Name**: `Department`
   - **Description**: `Employee's department`
   - **Data Type**: Select **Option**

![Option Type Column](/assets/docs/tutorials/adding-columns/07-option-type.png)

4. When you select "Option", additional fields appear:
   - **Allow Multi Selection** - checkbox to allow selecting multiple options
   - **Options grid** - where you define the available options
   
5. Click **"+ ADD OPTION"** to add department options:
   - Type `Engineering` in the first option
   - Click "+ ADD OPTION" again to add more departments (like "Sales", "Marketing", "HR")

6. Click **"SAVE"**

## Understanding Data Types

Sheety App offers various data types to match your data needs:

| Data Type | Description | Example Use Case |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| **Text** | Plain text or rich text (markdown) | Names, descriptions, notes |
| **Number** | Numeric values (integers or decimals) | Age, salary, quantity |
| **Check box** | True/false or yes/no values | Active status, completed tasks |
| **Date** | Date and optionally time | Birth date, hire date, deadline |
| **Option** | Single or multiple choice from predefined list | Department, status, category |
| **Row Reference** | Link to another row in a different sheet | Manager reference, related items |
| **Member** | Reference to workspace members | Assigned to, created by |
| **Sealed Option** | Once a user selects an option, only they can change it | Personal assignments, claimed items |
| **Vote** | Allow users to vote on options | Survey responses, polls |

:::note[Compute Columns]
There's also **Compute Columns** that automatically calculate values based on formulas. Right-click and select "Add Compute Column" to create one. Learn more in the [Computed Columns tutorial](/docs/tutorials/computed-columns).
:::

## Viewing Your Columns in the Sheet

After adding your columns, your sheet now displays them as column headers!

![Sheet with Columns](/assets/docs/tutorials/adding-columns/09-sheet-with-columns.png)

Your sheet now has:
- ✅ **Full Name** column (Text)
- ✅ **Email** column (Text)
- ✅ **Department** column (Option)
- ✅ **Changed At** (system column added automatically)

You're now ready to start adding data to your sheet!

## Editing Columns with Right-Click

Once you've created columns, you can quickly edit them by right-clicking on the column header. This is much faster than navigating to the Column Management Page when you just need to make a quick change.

### How to Edit a Column

1. **Right-click** on any column header in the data grid
   - For example, right-click on the "Department" column header

![Right-Click Column Header](/assets/docs/tutorials/adding-columns/10-rightclick-edit-context-menu.png)

2. From the context menu, you'll see options:
   - **Edit [Column Name]** - Opens the Edit Column dialog
   - **Delete [Column Name]** - Removes the column (with confirmation)
   - **Add Column** - Adds a new column
   - **Add Compute Column** - Adds a computed column

3. Select **"Edit Department"** (or whichever column you're editing)

4. The "Edit Column" dialog opens with the same four tabs as when creating:

![Edit Column Dialog](/assets/docs/tutorials/adding-columns/11-edit-column-dialog.png)

5. Make your changes:
   - Update the **Name** or **Description**
   - Modify settings on any of the tabs
   - For Option columns, add or remove options from the list
   - Note: The **Data Type** cannot be changed after creation (it's disabled)

6. Click **"SAVE"** to apply your changes

:::caution[Data Type Cannot Be Changed]
Once a column is created, you cannot change its data type. If you need a different data type, you'll need to create a new column and optionally delete the old one.
:::

:::tip[Quick Edit Access]
Right-clicking on column headers gives you instant access to edit or delete columns without leaving the sheet view. This is perfect for making quick adjustments while working with your data!
:::

## Alternative: Using the Column Management Page

While right-clicking is the fastest way to add columns, you can also use the **Column Management Page** for more comprehensive column management. This is useful when you need to:

- View all columns at once
- Create multiple columns in succession
- Edit or delete existing columns
- Search for specific columns
- Organize your data structure

To access the Column Management Page:
1. Click the **three dots menu** (⋯) next to the sheet name
2. Select **"Columns"**

Learn more about the Column Management Page and its features in our [Column Management guide](/docs/guides/column-management).

## Best Practices for Columns

When creating columns, follow these best practices:

1. **Use descriptive names** - Make column names clear and self-explanatory
2. **Add descriptions** - Help team members understand what data goes in each column
3. **Choose the right data type** - Select the most appropriate type for your data
4. **Start simple** - Begin with essential columns and add more as needed
5. **Plan your structure** - Think about relationships between data before creating columns
