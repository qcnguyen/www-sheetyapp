title: Adding Data to Your Sheet
description: Learn how to add, edit, and manage data in your Sheety App sheets
---

Now that you've created your workbook, sheet, and defined your columns, it's time to start adding data! In this tutorial, you'll learn how to populate your sheet with information using the intuitive data entry interface.

## What You'll Learn

- How to add new rows to your sheet
- Understanding the Add Row dialog
- Entering data for different column types
- Editing existing rows
- Managing and deleting data

## Prerequisites

- A sheet with columns defined (complete [Adding Columns to Your Sheet](/docs/tutorials/adding-columns) if you haven't already)

## Understanding Data in Sheets

Before we start, let's understand how data works in Sheety App:

- Each **row** represents a single record (like one employee, one task, or one product)
- Each **column** contains a specific type of information for that record
- Data is saved automatically when you submit a row
- You can edit or delete rows at any time

## Step 1: Your Empty Sheet

When you first open a sheet with columns but no data, you'll see the column headers and an empty grid ready for data entry.

![Empty Sheet with Columns](/assets/docs/tutorials/adding-data/01-empty-sheet.png)

Notice the toolbar at the top with several options:
- **Filters** - Filter your data
- **Columns** - Show/hide columns
- **Search** - Search through your data
- **Add Row** - Add new data (this is what we'll use!)

## Step 2: Adding Your First Row

Let's add your first employee record to the sheet.

1. Click the **"ADD ROW"** button in the top-right corner of the toolbar

2. The "Add Row" dialog will open, showing input fields for all your columns:

![Add Row Dialog](/assets/docs/tutorials/adding-data/02-add-row-dialog.png)

The dialog displays:
- **Input fields** for each column in your sheet
- **Save button** to save your data
- **Info Panel** on the right (shows computed columns and triggers when applicable)

:::tip[Dialog vs. Inline Editing]
The Add Row dialog is perfect for entering complete records. You can also add rows by clicking directly in empty cells for quick data entry!

## Step 3: Filling in the Data

Now let's enter information for our first employee.

1. **Full Name** field:
   - Type: `John Smith`

2. **Email** field:
   - Type: `john.smith@company.com`

3. **Department** field (dropdown):
   - Click on the dropdown
   - Select: `Engineering`

![Filled Row Data](/assets/docs/tutorials/adding-data/03-filled-row-data.png)

:::note[Required Fields]
If a column is marked as required, you must fill it in before you can save the row. Optional fields can be left empty.
:::

4. Click the **"SAVE"** button to save your first row

## Step 4: Viewing Your Data

After saving, you'll see your new row appear in the sheet grid!

![First Row Added](/assets/docs/tutorials/adding-data/04-first-row-added.png)

Notice that your row now includes:
- ✅ **Checkbox** for row selection
- ✅ All the data you entered
- ✅ **Changed At** column automatically populated with the timestamp
- ✅ **Action buttons** (Edit and Detail) for managing the row

The bottom of the sheet shows "Total Rows: 1" - your first record is saved!

## Step 5: Adding More Rows

Let's add another employee to see how multiple records look.

1. Click **"ADD ROW"** again
2. Enter the following information:
   - **Full Name**: `Sarah Johnson`
   - **Email**: `sarah.johnson@company.com`
   - **Department**: `Engineering`
3. Click **"SAVE"**

Now you have multiple rows in your sheet!

![Multiple Rows](/assets/docs/tutorials/adding-data/05-multiple-rows.png)

:::tip[Quick Entry]
For faster data entry, after saving a row, the Add Row dialog automatically closes. Simply click "ADD ROW" again to add the next record. This makes batch data entry quick and efficient!
:::

## Alternative Method: Quick Inline Entry

For even faster data entry, you can add rows directly in the grid using the placeholder row at the bottom of your sheet. This method is perfect when you need to quickly enter data without opening dialogs.

### Step 1: Locate the Placeholder Row

Scroll to the bottom of your sheet data. You'll see an empty placeholder row with a light blue background:

![Placeholder Row](/assets/docs/tutorials/adding-data/07-inline-editing-start.png)

### Step 2: Start Typing

Simply click on any cell in the placeholder row and start typing. The cell will become editable:

1. Click on the **Full Name** cell in the placeholder row
2. Type: `Michael Brown`

The cell activates as an editable field as you type!

### Step 3: Move to Next Field

Press **Tab** or click the next cell to move to the Email field:

1. Type: `michael.brown@company.com`

![Inline Editing Email](/assets/docs/tutorials/adding-data/08-inline-editing-email.png)

### Step 4: Fill Remaining Fields

Continue filling in the remaining fields:

1. Press **Tab** or click the Department cell
2. Start typing `Engineering` - a dropdown will appear
3. Click on **"Engineering"** from the dropdown

![Inline Editing Complete](/assets/docs/tutorials/adding-data/09-inline-editing-complete.png)

### Step 5: Save the Row

Once all fields are filled, click the **Save** button that appears on the right side of the row.

![Inline Editing Saved](/assets/docs/tutorials/adding-data/10-inline-editing-saved.png)

The row is saved and moves up to join your other data rows. A new empty placeholder row appears at the bottom, ready for the next entry!

:::tip[Choose Your Method]
- Use the **Add Row dialog** for structured entry with helpful field labels
- Use **inline editing** for rapid data entry when you're familiar with your columns
Both methods save your data the same way - choose what works best for your workflow!

## Editing Existing Data

Need to update information? Sheety App makes it easy to edit existing rows.

### Method 1: Using the Edit Button

1. Locate the row you want to edit
2. Click the **Edit** button (pencil icon) on the right side of the row
3. The "Edit Row" dialog opens with all current data pre-filled

![Edit Row Dialog](/assets/docs/tutorials/adding-data/06-edit-row-dialog.png)

4. Make your changes
5. Click **"SAVE"** to update the row

### Method 2: Inline Editing (Quick Edit)

For faster edits, you can click directly on any cell and start typing to edit it inline.

1. **Click on any cell** you want to edit (or start typing directly)
2. The cell becomes editable with a text input field

![Inline Edit Existing](/assets/docs/tutorials/adding-data/11-inline-edit-existing.png)

3. Make your changes
4. Press **Enter** to save the change

![Inline Edit Saved](/assets/docs/tutorials/adding-data/12-inline-edit-saved.png)

The row is automatically updated and the timestamp changes to reflect the edit!

:::tip[Quick Tip]
- Press **Enter** to save changes
- Press **Escape** to cancel without saving
- The timestamp automatically updates when you save
:::

## Managing Your Data

### Selecting Rows

You can select rows for bulk operations:

- **Select one row** - Click the checkbox at the left of any row
- **Select all rows** - Click the checkbox in the header row
- **Select multiple rows** - Hold **Ctrl** (Windows) or **Cmd** (Mac) while clicking checkboxes

### Deleting Rows

To delete one or more rows:

1. Select the row(s) you want to delete using the checkboxes
2. Click the **"DELETE ROW"** button in the toolbar (becomes enabled when rows are selected)
3. Confirm the deletion in the dialog that appears

:::caution[Permanent Deletion]
Deleting rows is permanent and cannot be undone. Make sure you want to delete the data before confirming!
:::

### Viewing Row Details

Click the **"Detail"** button (⋮) next to any row to see:
- Complete row information
- Row history and changes
- Related data from other sheets (if using Row Reference columns)

## Understanding Column Types in Data Entry

Different column types provide different input methods:

| Column Type | Data Entry Method | Example |
|-------------|------------------|---------|
| **Text** | Text input field | Name, description, notes |
| **Number** | Numeric input field | Age, quantity, price |
| **Check box** | Toggle switch | Active/Inactive, Yes/No |
| **Date** | Date picker | Birth date, deadline |
| **Option** | Dropdown selection | Department, Status, Priority |
| **Row Reference** | Searchable dropdown | Manager, Related item |
| **Member** | Member selector | Assigned to, Created by |

:::tip[Smart Inputs]
Sheety App provides intelligent input controls based on your column types. For example, date columns show a calendar picker, and Option columns show dropdowns with your predefined choices!
:::

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Speed up your data entry with these shortcuts:

- **Tab** - Move to next field
- **Shift + Tab** - Move to previous field
- **Enter** - Save row (in Add/Edit dialog)
- **Escape** - Close dialog without saving
- **Ctrl/Cmd + S** - Quick save (when editing inline)

## Best Practices for Data Entry

Follow these tips for efficient and accurate data entry:

1. **Be Consistent** - Use the same format for similar data (e.g., "Engineering" not "engineering" or "eng")
2. **Use Dropdowns** - Leverage Option columns for standardized choices
3. **Validate as You Go** - Check your data immediately after entry
4. **Complete Required Fields** - Fill in all required information to avoid incomplete records
5. **Use Bulk Import** - For large datasets, consider using the import feature (covered in another tutorial)
