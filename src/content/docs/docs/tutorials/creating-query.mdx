title: Creating Sheet Queries
description: Learn how to create queries to filter and select data from your sheets
---

Queries in Sheety App allow you to filter and select specific columns from your sheets, making it easier to work with your data in apps and widgets. This tutorial will guide you through creating your first query.

## What You'll Learn

- How to access the Queries section
- Creating a query to select specific columns
- Understanding query configuration options
- Viewing query results

## Prerequisites

- Access to Sheety App at your instance URL
- A workbook with at least one sheet containing data
- Complete the [Creating Your First Workbook](/docs/tutorials/creating-your-first-workbook) tutorial

## Understanding Queries

Queries allow you to:
- Select specific columns from a sheet
- Filter data using Q-Predicate expressions
- Transform and aggregate data for use in apps and visualizations

Queries are essential for creating widgets in apps, as widgets require queries to specify what data to display.

## Step 1: Accessing the Queries Section

From your workbook sidebar, you'll need to expand the Data section to access Queries:

1. Look for the expandable sections in the left sidebar
2. Click to expand the section that contains **"Fields"** and **"Queries"**
3. Click on **"Queries"** to navigate to the Queries page

![Empty Queries Page](/assets/docs/tutorials/creating-query/01-queries-page.png)

When you first access the Queries section in a new workbook, you'll see:
- A search bar to filter queries
- An **"ADD QUERY"** button in the top right
- The current count (0 queries found initially)
- A **"CREATE FIRST QUERY"** button to get started

## Step 2: Create a New Query

Click on the **"CREATE FIRST QUERY"** button. A menu will appear showing all available sheets in your workbook. Select the sheet you want to query data from.

For this tutorial, we'll use an "Employees" sheet that contains employee data with departments and salaries.

![Add Query Form](/assets/docs/tutorials/creating-query/02-add-query-form.png)

The Add Query form includes:
- **Targeted Sheet**: The sheet you selected (cannot be changed)
- **Query Name**: A descriptive name for your query
- **Filter Q-Predicate**: Optional filter expression to limit rows
- **Select Columns**: Choose which columns to include in the query results

## Step 3: Configure Your Query

Let's create a query to get salary information by department:

### 1. Enter a Query Name

Type a descriptive name for your query, for example: `Salary by Department`

### 2. Select Columns

Click on the **"Select Columns"** dropdown to see all available columns from your sheet.

For our salary by department query, select:
- **Department**: To group by department
- **Salary**: To show salary values

![Query Form Filled](/assets/docs/tutorials/creating-query/03-query-form-filled.png)

You can select multiple columns by clicking on each one. Selected columns will appear as chips above the dropdown.

### 3. Filter Q-Predicate (Optional)

The **Filter Q-Predicate** field allows you to filter which rows are included in the query results. This uses Sheety App's Q-Expression language.

For example:
- To filter only Engineering department: `[Department] = "Engineering"`
- To filter salaries above 50000: `[Salary] > 50000`
- To combine conditions: `[Department] = "Engineering" and [Salary] > 50000`

For this tutorial, we'll leave the filter empty to include all rows.

## Step 4: Save and View Results

Click the **"SAVE"** button to create your query. You'll be redirected to the query detail page showing the results.

![Query Result](/assets/docs/tutorials/creating-query/04-query-result.png)

The query result page displays:
- **Result tab**: Shows the data returned by your query
- **Definition tab**: Shows the query configuration
- A data grid with the selected columns
- Total row count at the bottom

In our example, the query returns all rows with Department and Salary columns, showing:
- 3 employees in the Engineering department
- 1 employee in the Legal department

:::note[About Aggregation]
The query we created returns individual rows. To aggregate data (like summing salaries per department), you'll use the aggregation features in widgets when creating apps. Queries provide the filtered data, while widgets apply aggregation functions like Sum, Average, Count, etc.

## Next Steps

Now that you've created a query, you can:

1. **Use it in an App**: Queries are required for adding widgets to apps. See [Creating Your First App](/docs/tutorials/creating-app) to learn how to use queries in widgets.
2. **Create More Complex Queries**: Add filter expressions to narrow down your data
3. **Experiment with Different Column Combinations**: Select different columns for different purposes

## Query Best Practices

:::tip[Best Practices]
- **Descriptive Names**: Give your queries clear, descriptive names that indicate what data they return
- **Select Only Needed Columns**: Only include columns you'll actually use to improve performance
- **Use Filters Wisely**: Filter data in queries rather than loading all data and filtering in widgets
- **Test Your Queries**: Always view the query results to verify they return expected data
:::

## Troubleshooting

### No Sheets Available

**Problem**: When trying to create a query, no sheets appear in the menu.

**Solution**: You need to create at least one sheet in your workbook first. Go to the Sheets section and create a sheet before creating queries.

### Empty Query Results

**Problem**: Query returns no rows (0 total rows).

**Solution**: Check that:
- Your sheet has data rows
- Your filter predicate (if used) isn't too restrictive
- Column names in filters match the actual column names exactly

### Query Not Appearing in Widget

**Problem**: After creating a query, it doesn't appear when configuring a widget.

**Solution**: Make sure you've saved the query successfully. Refresh the app edit page if needed.
