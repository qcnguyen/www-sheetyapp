---

Welcome to Sheety App! This tutorial will guide you through creating your first workbook from scratch. By the end of this guide, you'll have created a workbook with a sheet ready to store your data.

## What You'll Learn

- How to access the Sheety App
- Creating a new workbook
- Adding your first sheet to the workbook
- Understanding the sheet structure

## Prerequisites

- Access to Sheety App at your instance URL
- A user account (free or paid)

## Step 1: Accessing Sheety App

Open your browser and navigate to your Sheety App instance. You'll see the home page with a clean sidebar navigation on the left.

The main navigation includes:
- **Workbooks** - View all your workbooks
- **Create Workbook** - Quick access to create a new workbook
- **Subscription** - Manage your subscription
- **Settings** - Configure your account settings

## Step 2: Create a New Workbook

To create your first workbook:

1. Click on **"Create Workbook"** from the sidebar menu or click the **"CREATE WORKBOOK"** button on the home page.

2. You'll be presented with a simple form with two fields:
   - **Name**: Give your workbook a meaningful name
   - **Description**: Add a brief description of what this workbook will be used for

3. For this tutorial, let's create an employee management workbook:
   - **Name**: `My First Workbook`
   - **Description**: `A tutorial workbook to demonstrate Sheety App features`

4. Click the **"SAVE"** button to create your workbook.

## Step 3: Welcome to Your Workbook

After creating your workbook, you'll be taken to the workbook home page. This page displays:

- A welcome message
- A **"CREATE A SHEET"** button to get started
- A sidebar with workbook navigation including:
  - Sheets
  - Apps
  - Workbook Settings
- Latest news and updates section

The workbook is now created, but it's empty. The next step is to add a sheet where you'll store your data.

## Step 4: Create Your First Sheet

Sheets in Sheety App are similar to tables in a database or sheets in a spreadsheet. Each sheet stores a specific type of data.

To create a sheet:

1. Click the **"CREATE A SHEET"** button from the workbook home page.

2. You'll see the "Add Sheet" form with:
   - **Name**: The name of your sheet
   - **Description**: What data this sheet will contain

3. For this tutorial, let's create an employee sheet:
   - **Name**: `Employees`
   - **Description**: `A sheet to manage employee information`

![Create Sheet Form Filled](/assets/docs/tutorials/first-workbook/06-create-sheet-filled.png)

4. Click **"SAVE"** to create the sheet.

## Step 5: Understanding Your Empty Sheet

After creating the sheet, you'll see an empty sheet view with a helpful message:

![Empty Sheet View](/assets/docs/tutorials/first-workbook/07-empty-sheet.png)

> **No Columns Defined**
> 
> This sheet doesn't have any columns yet. Right-click anywhere to add your first column and start building your data structure.
> 
> 💡 Tip: Right-click and select "Add Column" to get started

This is perfectly normal! A new sheet starts empty without any columns. In the next steps, you would:

1. Right-click to add columns (like Name, Email, Department, etc.)
2. Define the data type for each column
3. Start adding data rows
