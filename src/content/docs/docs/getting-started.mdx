## Key Features

### Workbooks
Workbooks are containers for your sheets and apps. Think of them as projects or databases - each workbook can contain multiple sheets and custom applications.

### Sheets
Sheets are where your data lives. Similar to database tables or spreadsheet tabs, sheets have:
- **Columns** - Define what type of data you store
- **Rows** - Individual records of data
- **Views** - Different ways to visualize and filter your data

### Apps
Build custom applications on top of your data without coding. Create forms, dashboards, and interfaces that interact with your sheets.

- **Left Sidebar** - Quick access to workbooks and settings
- **Top Bar** - Context-specific actions and notifications
